I am a junior student major in Computer Science in the School of Data Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

I currently study as visiting student in [X-Pixel](https://xpixel.group/people.html) Group supervised by Prof. [Chao Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OSDCB0UAAAAJ). I work closely with Ph.D. [Jinjin Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uMQ-G-QAAAAJ&hl=eng) who is intresed in interpretability of deep learning algorithm.

Recently, I mainly focus on the Generative Model, Image Quality Assessment and Interpretability of Deep Learning in Image Processing field.
